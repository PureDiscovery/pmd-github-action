[Full Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-github-action/compare/7a92e4f0f1a963c40cf10ad9d01e4140ffe354e2...v1.0.0)

First release of the official GitHub Action for PMD.

This action runs [PMD](https://pmd.github.io) static code analysis checks.

It can execute PMD with your own ruleset against your project. It creates a [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html) report which is uploaded as a build artifact. Furthermore the build can be failed based on the number of violations.
